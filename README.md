## Overview
`MSE_image_comparison` is a Raspberry Pi-based application that utilizes the Pi Camera for live image capture and analysis. Leveraging Python and OpenCV, the system computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between captured images and predefined benchmarks. Based on the MSE, it dynamically displays corresponding facial expressions, providing an interactive experience in mood detection.

## Features
- **Real-Time Image Processing:** Captures and processes images continuously.
- **Mood Detection:** Utilizes MSE to determine and display various facial expressions.
- **Raspberry Pi Integration:** Seamlessly combines hardware and software for an engaging setup.

## Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+ or newer recommended)
- Pi Camera Module
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Tkinter library (for GUI)

## Installation
1. Set up your Raspberry Pi and connect the Pi Camera.
2. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
3. Install OpenCV and other dependencies:
